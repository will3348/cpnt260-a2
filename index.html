    <h2 class="ph">What Is Badminton</h2>
    <section class="paragraph">

        <br>
        Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played
        with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles"
        (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach;
        formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the
        racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
        <br>
        <br>
        Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has
        struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing
        side.
        <br><br>
        The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the
        balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to
        decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports.
        The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.
        <br><br>
        The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to
        be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by
        China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles,
        men's doubles, and women's doubles, with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of play, the
        sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is
        also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet
        movements.
